	<h3>Block Level Elements</h3>
	<p>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>


	<h3>Inline Elements</h3>
	<p>An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>



	<p>This is a <div style="border:2px red solid;">Hello</div> div</p>



	<p>This is a <span style="border:2px red solid;">Hello</span> span</p>
